pysha256 is a pure python implementation of sha256 I wrote to get a better feel for how the sha256 works. I did a lot of copying and translating from the [psuedocode on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode).

This is purely an academic exercise. There are no optimizations.

A quick bitcoin hashing benchmark gave me 4 hashes/second.
